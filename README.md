# Introduction

This project is the backend of Vidly, an video rental app.

## Vidli API Using Node.js

 In this project, I built a RESTful API, a backend service that allows users to rent movies from a movie rental app. I added a few endpoints to let any user view a list of movies in stock, rent a movie, or return a movie. A user can view a list of movies in stock. But an account is required in order to rent or return a movie. I created the following endpoints for the API client:

***User***
- user signup
- user authentication

***Movie***
- movie create
- movie show
- movie index
- movie update
- movie delete

***Genre***
- genre create
- genre show
- genre index
- genre update
- genre delete

***Customer***
- customer create
- customer show
- customer index
- customer update
- customer delete

***Rental***
- rental create
- rental show
- rental index

***Return***
- return create
- return show
- return index

***Built with***
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
